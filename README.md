# What is CubeLab?
- CubeLab is a 2D Logic/Rage-Platformer. It's my first project, during which I'll hopefully learn everything I need to know about C# and Unity2D!

# v0.6.6 Changelog:
- Level 13 (the first energy field level) was remade
- Added Level 22
- Added a level before DemoEnd screen (Transition level into the Negative Section)
- New DemoEnd screen
- Added particles for the upcoming Negative Section
- Added textures for Negative Inverted gravity field, Negative default background, and more.

## Known bugs:
- When you Jump right before going on a Jump Pad, it sends you to low earth orbit
- you can't place cubes into walls, but you can into spikes
- Report the bugs you see!

## Other Info:
- The plot was partially scrapped, decided it really doesn't matter.
- I was planning on adding the bossfight between this and negative section first, but I will probably add bossfights later on.
- The preparations for Negative Section levels are going well.
