# What is CubeLab?
- CubeLab is a 2D Logic/Rage-Platformer. It's my first project, during which I'll hopefully learn everything I need to know about C# and Unity2D!

# v0.6.6 Changelog:
- Level 13 (the first energy field level) was remade
- Added Level 22
- Added a level before DemoEnd screen
- New DemoEnd screen

## Known bugs:
- When you Jump right before going on a Jump Pad, it sends you to low earth orbit
- you can't place cubes into walls, but you can into spikes
- Report the bugs you see!

## Other Info:
- The plot was partially scrapped, decided it really doesn't matter.
